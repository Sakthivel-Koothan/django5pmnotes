what is web application?
------------------------
	a web application is a server-side program that utilizes web browsers and web technologies to perform a task over the web/internet.

	the most of the web applications are implemented by using 3-tier architecture.

	to draw the 3-tier architecture fig

what are requirements to required developing an web applications?
----------------------------------------------------
1).Technologies
2).IDE's
3).Design pattern
4).runtime environments

Technologies:
-------------
	the technologies are can be categorized into 3-types,they are

	1).client side technologies

	2).server side technologies

	3).database technologies

client-side technologies:
-------------------------
	these technologies are used to build webpages and to perform the client-side validations.

	these technologies are used to implement the presentation logics.

	the client side technologies are

		HTML
		CSS
		JAVA SCRIPT
		....
		....

	we can executeing the client-side programs to required  web browsers.

	the most popular web browsers are chrome,firefox,IE,safari,opera,....

server-side technologies:
-------------------------
	these technologies are used to take the request from the client/enduser,process that request and give back the response to that request.

	these technologies are used to implement the business logics and to perform a server-side validations.

	the server side technologies are python,java,.net,php,ruby,....

	we can execute the server-side programs to required middleware servers.

	the middleware servers are                       apache tomcat,glasfish,WAS,IIS,DDS,....

database technologies:
---------------------
	these technologies are used to implement the database logics(create,manipulate and delete).

	SQL is the most common database technology/language

	we can executeing database logics to required database servers.

	the database servers are oracle,sqlite,mysql,sql server,teradata,DB2,postgresql,....



IDE's
-----
	IDE's(Integrated Development Environment's) provides faster development of the application and to perform automatic debugging.

	the most popular IDE's are  pycharm,atom,eclipse,netbeans,visualstudio,....


architecture:
-------------	
	the most of the web applications are following MVC designpattern.

	MVC(Model View Controller)

	we can developing any web application by using MVC design pattern we will get some benefits,that benefits are

	1).parallel development is possible

	2).reduce the development time and development cost

runtime environments:
--------------------
	we can run our project public domain in that case to required runtime environments.

	the most popular runtime environments are heroku,pythonanywhere.com,cloud(aws,azure,gcp,...)
