View:
-----
a view is a python function or class,which is used to representing the business logics.

a view take the request from the end user,process that request and give back the response to the enduser.

	we can implement the views in views.py file of the application.

	every view should be registered with a url pattern in urls.py file.

types of views:
--------------
	views can be categorized into two types,they are

1).Function based views

2).class based views.

function based views:
--------------------
	we can create a view by using functions,that type of views are called function based views.

	whenever our requested url is matching of any one url pattern of urls.py file to return the request object,that request object is passing to parameter of the view function and our view function will be executed.

	in function based views,we can perform different http methods like GET(),POST(),PUT(),DELETE(),..., by using conditional statements.

ex:
---
create a django project to display current system date and time on the browser?

step1:
------
to create a project

	django-admin startproject projectname

(myvenv) F:\django5pm>django-admin startproject proj3

step2:
-----
goto project location and create an application in that project location.

	cd projectname

	python manage.py startapp applicationname

(myvenv) F:\django5pm>cd proj3

(myvenv) F:\django5pm\proj3>python manage.py startapp app3

step3:
-----
to install our application in settings.py file of the project

	settings.py
	-----------
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    
    'app3'
]

step4:
------
to create a view in views.py file of the application
	views.py
	--------
from django.shortcuts import render
from datetime import datetime
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def dateandtime(request):
    now=datetime.now()
    return HttpResponse("the current system Date and time is: "+str(now))


step5:
------
to configure the url pattern for our view in urls.py file of the project.

	urls.py
	-------
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app3 import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('dt/',views.dateandtime)
]

step6:
-----
to apply the migrate

	python manage.py migrate

step7:
-----
to start the server

	python manage.py runserver

step8:
-----
to send the request

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/dt

ex:
---
to  create django project with single application with multiple views?

step1:
-----
	to create a django project
	
	django-admin startproject projectname

(myvenv) F:\django5pm>django-admin startproject proj4

step2:
------
	goto project location and create an application in that project location.

	cd projectname

	python manage.py startapp applicationname

(myvenv) F:\django5pm>cd proj4

(myvenv) F:\django5pm\proj4>python manage.py startapp app4 

step3:
-----
to install our application in settings.py file of the project.
	settings.py
	-----------
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    
    'app4'
]

step4:

def dateandtime(request):
    now=datetime.now()
    return HttpResponse("the current system Date and time is: "+str(now))

def wishes(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Hello siva <i>Good morning</i></h1>")


step5:
------
to configure the url patterns for our views in urls.py file

	urls.py
	--------
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from app4 import viewsstep7
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('wel/',views.wishes),
    path('dt/',views.dateandtime)
]


step6:
-----
to apply the migrate
	
	python manage.py migrate

step7:

to start the server

	python manage.py runserver

step8:
------
to send the request to the server

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/wel
