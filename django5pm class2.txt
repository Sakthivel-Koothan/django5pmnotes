what is HTML?
------------
	HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is a markup language,it is used to build the webpages.

	it provides structure of the webpages

	the latest HTML version is HTML5

	HTML contains elements,whenever we are representing html elements with in angular brackets (<>),is known as html tag.

	<element>		--> opening tag

	</element>		--> closeing tag


	we can implement the html code,dont required any external softwares,just we need required editors(notepad,notepad++,editplus,...) ans browsers(chrome,firefox,opera,IE,safari,..).

	we can save the html file,by using .html/.htm extension

    </title>
  </head>
